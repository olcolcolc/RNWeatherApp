- `humidity`: The humidity percentage. Can be `null`.
- `sunrise`: The sunrise time as a string. Can be `null`.

### MainPanel

#### Props:
- `weatherCondition` - the current weather condition. This could be any string like "Sunny", "Rainy", etc. If the value is null, it means the weather condition is not available.
- `tempCelsius` -  the current temperature in Celsius. If the value is null, it means the temperature is not available.
- `isDay` - A flag indicating whether it's day or night. 1 means it's day, 0 means it's night. If the value is null, it means this information is not available.

### WeeklyForecastElement

### WeeklyForecastDetailsModal
Displays detailed weather forecast information for a specific date within a modal. It provides information such as weather condition, temperature, humidity, wind speed, sunrise time, and chances of snow or rain.

### ErrorModal
Displays a modal with an error message. The visibility of the modal is controlled by the errorModalVisible property of the modalStore. When the modal's backdrop is pressed or the "Close" button is clicked, the toggleErrorModalVisible method of the modalStore is called to hide the modal. The error message displayed in the modal is the error property of the weatherStore.
